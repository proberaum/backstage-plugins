# 🧪 Proberaum* for Backstage Plugins

*German for rehearsal room

> This repo contains multiple early-stage Backstage plugins. The processes, tooling, and workflows are based on those in [backstage/community-plugins](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins). Thanks to the Backstage Community, Spotify and Red Hat for making this setup public.
>
> This is somehow a incubator for new plugins. I like to move some of them later into the Backstage Community Plugins repo if there is a demand for some of them. But for the first iterations it's easier to create them here.
>
> Anyway, some of these plugins (GitHub Notifications) are IMHO already stable enough for production. But please notice that this repository does not provide commerical or official support.
>
> Feel free to raise issues or PRs in this repository. I'm open for any kind of feedback or contributions to existing plugins.*
